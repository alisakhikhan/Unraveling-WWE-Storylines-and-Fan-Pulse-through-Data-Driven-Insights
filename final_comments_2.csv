Here's just how stale. It appears that somewhere a long the line the world of WWE has forgotten that Roman was a double champion.  He was the WWE world champion and the WWE universal champion. HHH walks out and hands him a new title and then he has three title belts. It didn't take them long to take the other two away that we never see anymore and they announce Roman and talk about his title reign as the Universal champion. They never mention WWE champion anymore.
They wanted to put the world title on Seth so instead of simply having him beat Roman for the title because they didn't want to break up the titles and have him lose one of them.  So they make a new title and have a few wrestlers compete in matches and the two remaining fight for the title.  Instead of a stellar match with Seth and Roman which would have been awesome they basically insulted us who watched all thise matches where the bloodline cheated so Roman could keep both of his titles they simply took one away and made a new belt and title. It sort of makes both of those titles ridiculous and not very prestigious in my opinion.  Which leads me to use the word stale because they seemingly have run out of gas with the bloodline.  It's obvious to me that down the road Jimmy and Jey will be a tag team again.",bloodline like every faction soon thing past. bad gone already honestly become old stale.

IuwIkiGr4Ws,Josh O,"For further clarification, from someone close to the family, Bray was vaccinated but got Covid anyways last year.  Early this year, he got a Covid vaccine booster, and ended up with side effects of a severe case of heart inflammation.  This myocarditis was pretty bad, but Windham's heart was slowly getting better throughout the following months.  Many people that are susceptible to side effects (particularly men under 50) can end up getting clotting from the vaccine within a few months after a booster, and this may be what caused the heart attack, or Windham may have believed his injuries from the vaccine were more recovered than reality, and pushed himself too hard.

WWE is trying to keep the vaccine-cause under wraps as this issue has been heavily politicized.  The FCC along with similar acting agencies in Canada, Britain, etc., and even social media companies have guidelines that set limits on how you can talk about Covid and related subjects, and there are specific guidelines around how you can talk about vaccines, and the banning of vaccine misinformation.  Obviously, we know speech that denies the effectiveness or safety is banned and eligible for fines on TV, but a specific section of these guidelines prohibit talking about ""true cases that could fuel vaccine hesitancy"" as well as true statistics, personal accounts, and concerns.  The way these rules are written differ from each country, which channel they are on, or which social media platform they get posted to, but nearly all contain vaguely worded guidelines meant to fight vaccine hesitancy which punishes any content that could make a viewer hesitant to take a vaccine, even when the information is objectively proven true.  The WWE has chosen to keep it vague and not get into the cause of death, one because it is not worth the risk of getting fined or having their accounts banned on social media, and secondly, they don't want Windham Rotunda's passing becoming a battleground for politicized arguments.  Windham is not the first athlete to suffer a severe vaccine injury, and it be kept under wraps for these reasons.  

This is what I know so far.","clarification, someone close family, Bray vaccinated got Covid anyways last year.

Isn't it ironic that Samoa Joe, arguably the best Samoan wrestler, is the only one not related to someone in the Samoan Dynasty?

Thinking out of the box I think The Bloodline should be given another ""tribe"" to fight that will force them back together to defend their Dynasty.  My suggestion would be: The Guerrillas of Destiny.  They should bring in Haku, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa and Hikuleo for a Samoan vs Tongan tribal feud.

The one thing that bothers me about the CM Punk ""I'm the real champ."" story is that he pulled that belt out on an episode of Collision that featured MJF in the main event tag match.  Punk paraded his version of the belt around in a promo and Max said absolutely nothing about it?  That is totally out of character for MJF, even the pseudo Face MJF that is a part of the BTYBayBay angle.  To me it's a huge hole in the story and a glaring omission that makes absolutely zero sense.","WWE needs sign Jacob Fatu MLW Roman's second bodyguard alongside Solo. ironic Samoa Joe, arguably best Samoan wrestler, one related someone Samoan Dynasty?

pSu2WZxe0ts,‚Äòs all good man,"I really think Jey should win. wwe can go in a lot of interesting directions with that win‚Ä¶

After winning, Jey turns on Jimmy. Harping back to what Roman said during tribal court, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not me, that‚Äôs who i was forced to be.‚Äù Jey is overcome by the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of tribal chief and does to jimmy what has been done to him for years. 

that leads to jey (with solo) vs jimmy at Payback. during the match solo is going to spike jimmy until jey has a change of heart. disgusted at what has become of his family, he stops his little brother, helps pick up his twin, and they all embrace in the middle of the ring. match ends in no contest. 

next week of smackdown Jey comes out with his brothers and drops the tribal chief title as well as the undisputed championship. he chooses family over titles. 

‚Äúheavy is the head that wears the crown. jey wasn‚Äôt ready yet, jimmy will never be so it‚Äôs time for the real tribal chief to take his rightful place at the head of the table‚Äù as paul is crowning roman..

From where My friend was it Looks like The fiend plus the intro we got was Nice live but in the arena before the Red & black Dark üö® lights.. people like 70% of the 70% seat filled were thinking That Punk was coming straight out.
Instead They were chanting to silence..
Few Fans usually get cues.. nothing. But after Saturday. Chant restarted & from the actual camera it looked bad üòû.. I don't get how this place had The whole top empty and mixed up All over the The oddest was where the cam usually is. Hundred of floor level seats empty ( The camera Man sent a message to...I guess Punk.. That it was an extreme close up even in the Ring.

*** Second funny thing
When Samoa Joe chopped Punk it was hallow sound & a lot of people Heard CM Punk say "" Joe That fkin hurt""! LoL üòÜ..
Lite hearted fun..
But then I see now right After the observer had The colission decline numbers ( New numbers emerged?)
These numbers are primarily for advertising and if it's DVR 1% watch a commercial.. so I'm lost Why an adjustment number is showing up After Dave MELTZER had his Saturday drop starting with the 816( saying overall The DVR added to make it 952..
(( Now if that's The Case this week on non live but it's considered First run That means before secondary tapings..
452..so instead of

The extreme close up on punk... never ever seen so close to someone.. dynamite tapings drift off by the time they get to Roh and Those crowds look more full then this..
....
It's too good of talent to make These issues look bad..

I would say the broken arm is partly Bryan's fault.  It looked like he was too close to the corner Okada was leaping from.  This caused Okada's arc from top turnbuckle to mat to be more vertical and less horizontal, meaning his center of gravity fell pretty much straight down onto Bryan's arm.  Okada should've dragged him toward the center of the ring before climbing the turnbuckles, but when he failed to do so, Bryan should've been aware of his position and rolled himself over.  Or perhaps they should've done KAIRI's insane elbow, which is much better suited for such a short distance, instead of a standard flying elbow drop.

Regardless, I hope Bryan has a speedy recovery, and that they figure out a way to keep him (safely) involved in the upcoming events, even if he can't wrestle.","Turbo Jack speaks French?

ulh6L04-d0I,Colin Killick,"This was great! Making the belts (except the world title) somewhat brand exclusive would give the brands real identity.

Possible followup video: what should happen to Rampage, since it apparently isn't getting cancelled?

I actually think the best thing might be to scrap it and put ROH TV in the timeslot instead, if TNT would go for that. In a post-Collision world, I think even fewer people will be interested in watching what would clearly be an AEW C-show, whereas if you explicitly treat it like the NXT of AEW with its own fully self-contained storylines and belts regularly changing hands, it has a chance to be appointment TV with a consistent audience. Even if it dropped off to, say, 300k a week, that's 10 times more viewers than it has right now on Honor Club, which would drive viewers to the ROH PPVs and likely be a better developmental environment for their young talent than Rampage is now. 

Alternatively, you could also make Rampage into the all-women's weekly show that folks like Mickie James have been pushing for. It would instantly more than double the TV exposure that the womens' division gets now, and give them a chance to build more than two storylines at a time.","great!

Gargano showed up on RAW, AEW edgebois went on a tear cause ""how dare Gargano not join AEW after a potential tease"", never mind that MJF got his contract and is staying till 2024 at least.

SFl6zLQUSSI,theSector7Slumdogg VII,Yeah i had assumed undisputed or unified champion meant they would get rid of the 2 belts and go down to one unified undisputed championship lmao,Yeah assumed undisputed unified champion meant would get rid 2 belts go one unified undisputed championship lmao,0.9524,Positive
SFl6zLQUSSI,Truvi,"I believe that titles should feel like Eras. 

I believe every change of the belt, should result in a change of look. Not necessarily a new look every time. But for example, let‚Äôs say that Cody wins at WrestleMania, he could decide to commission a new belt or choose an old belt (this should be his choice not pre-determined). 

This should signify the end of one era, and the beginning of a new Era. 

Kinda like when a President is selected, they change the Oval Office. 

I think, the idea of having a quick run should be over. A quick run should be considered anything less than a year. There needs to be more prestige behind titles, and it‚Äôs hard to build prestige in a 3 hour title run. 

For example, imagine Cody claws his way to finally be the one person who could beat Roman, and then loses it in a month. Look how weak that makes, not just Cody look, but Roman as well. Title reigns should be long and weathered. 

So making a new belt every time isn‚Äôt a terrible idea. And the new belt should focus on the strengths of the past. 

For example, bring back the winged eagle, with the logo of the current belt, and the shape of the spinner. (Just an example). 

But maybe Cody chooses that option, but maybe someone like Ziggler would choose the old Winged eagle belt, and John wants the spinner back, or wants a more refine and professional looking spinner. Either way, titles would be associated with runs and eras. Rather than being associated with 50 different holders, maybe they would be associated with 5 era‚Äôs. 

Maybe edge brings back big Gold for his last run. These choices should bring personality and originality to reigns. 

1000 days shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a once in a generation, but rather, a bettering of the sport. 

In fact, I think wrestling is maturing to a point where it is becoming more sports like. And press conferences are important in this aspect. 

Kabib isn‚Äôt gonna be a legend for mic work, but work rate. 

No everyone should be a Kabib, some can be a McGregor. 

Some will talk well, some will fight well, and some will simply do both. But in any case, all should be protected, not for themselves but for the prestige of the belts.","believe titles feel like Eras. believe every change belt, result change look. necessarily new look every time. example, let‚Äôs say Cody wins WrestleMania, could decide commission new belt choose old belt (this choice pre-determined). signify end one era, beginning new Era.

UISUuAT927Y,That Canadian Vaper Guy,"I think Lacey should definitely play into the marine background, but play it more natural. Dress normally and maybe slap some camo on special occasions, if they *really* have to. 


But I also get why Sgt. Slaughter and family feel slighted at Lacey basically taking his gimmick. It'd be weird as hell if someone like lets say... Baron Corbin randomly adopting the Undertaker gimmick even if the Undertaker told him he can't use it. No family relation, it wasn't passed on properly and its blatantly obvious they're ripping the gimmick. 

Or The Miz coming out of no where as the second coming of the American Dream, despite Cody taking the gimmick and adding his own twist to it. Or Dom Mysterio becoming the new Dragon and coming out with the costume if Ricky Steamboat said he didn't give his blessing. Or hell, Rick Boogs suddenly becoming The Macho Dude or Dolph Ziggler becoming The Incredible Warrior. 

If they take a gimmick and create something out of that inspiration, then that's fine. Blatantly knocking off someone's gimmick even when that person said it isn't cool, then yeah. That's pretty slimy.

And I get it, Sgt Slaughter was a dodger and never really drafted. But the gimmicks a gimmick, Sting isn't out in the streets defending justice with a baseball bat. Lacey is probably the only one that can actually pull off a marine gimmick without being blasted for it.","think Lacey definitely play marine background, play natural.

The World Heavyweight Championship in WWE has always played second fiddle to the WWE Championship, it's been that way ever since the Big Gold belt was brought to WWE. During the life of the Big Gold belt in WWE, it was usually around the waist of wrestlers that the company deemed as less important than those wearing the WWE Championship. These are facts that we all know. With the WWE Championship and Universal Championship being unified now (them being separate doesn't matter as they are treated as one, like Randy Orton from 2013-14) that is the current WWE Championship. This new World Heavyweight Championship being given to Raw is very similar to what's been done in years past. With all of this info THAT WE ARE ALL AWARE OF, how is anyone pissed off about this???

2DIlq_leK6c,Matt,"If a rumored legal notice went out I highly doubt it would be threatening a lawsuit because realistically AEW doesn‚Äôt want any part of that and all the bad PR that would come out as part of a trial and the discovery process. More likely a legal notice would be one warning Punk that if he doesn‚Äôt show up and agree to perform as he‚Äôs being booked that he will be considered in breach of his contract and that the company will take whatever legal remedies available to them. And the likely legal remedy would be releasing him due to him breaching his contract which would allow for them to let him go and not continue paying him his likely multi million dollar salary while doing so. I would guess that his deal is pretty iron clad in guarantees for his money and about whether he can be cut loose free and clear or not. There‚Äôs likely language stating that even if he were released he‚Äôd still be paid X amount through the end date of the agreement unless he is released for cause where they would then not owe him the money. This legal notice if it exists would likely be setting the paper trail that he was told what to do, company acted in good faith to come to a mutual agreement with him to continue working together, company told him what the terms would be bringing him back, he refused to return despite being told he was being brought back, and he was clearly informed if he didn‚Äôt return he‚Äôd be in breach. And then if he doesn‚Äôt return they can argue that he knew he would be in breach and chose to not comply anyways if he tried to come after them for owing him the rest of his deal. Again we have no actual proof of any of that but that would be the likely scenario over simply saying they‚Äôll sue him. Neither side likely wants s lawsuit especially AEW and the microscope it would put all of their internal processes and management process under if one came.","rumored legal notice went highly doubt would threatening lawsuit realistically AEW doesn‚Äôt want part bad PR would come part trial discovery process. likely legal notice would one warning Punk doesn‚Äôt show agree perform he‚Äôs booked considered breach contract company take whatever legal remedies available them. likely legal remedy would releasing due breaching contract would allow let go continue paying likely multi million dollar salary so. would guess deal pretty iron clad guarantees money whether cut loose free clear not.

4) Tag champs can float between brands? Idk that works well enough for me I guess lmao

6) Free agency reserved for Big names that can sell it and tag teams. Join a tag team, get a name, get a tee shirt, congratulations now you've cheated the system and can float between brands.

9) Someone. Please, please anyone. Remember there's multiple factions on the brand. We could all be fighting all the time instead of just standing around backstage talking about Cricket wireless.

PdSaPXvQcEI,Jason Farino,"Why do you keep calling the new World heavyweight title the consolation prize It should actually be the main belt.

No other wrestling federation including WWE and its history other than the last decade had anything other than a world heavyweight champion. This also found in boxing UFC or any other competitive sport that is the same demographic generally as professional wrestling.

Having a WWE title and a universal title is unnecessary and stupid especially since there's nothing universe about it. The concept of a world heavyweight champion is you have one champion who can defend that title all over the world which is based in our world of reality which is just earth I don't believe Mars Pluto and Jupiter are currently having wrestling federations that we can compete against to be more solar system-ish or in other galaxies to be an actual universe and have a universal champion.



For the real gimmick belts have been the WWE and universal only there to support the brand split which has been nonsense and unnecessary from the start.

The World heavyweight title latest introduce looks more like a world heavyweight title you'd see in any other federation and should be the only belt and after Roman reigns hits his stupid thousand days as champion that they're clearly going for let him retire with the belts and end those belts and just go to one world heavyweight champion for the entire WWE which will bring credibility back to that title and it should always have been the world heavyweight champion.

So anybody saying this is a consolation prize it kind of a mark this has been the staple the rock hulk Hogan Ric flair Steve Austin The undertaker Sean Michaels have all won the World heavyweight title most of them have not won just the blank WWE title and none of them have won nor should they need to win something as stupid as the universal title.",keep calling new World heavyweight title consolation prize actually main belt. wrestling federation including WWE history last decade anything world heavyweight champion. also found boxing UFC competitive sport demographic generally professional wrestling.

It shows that Cody can win big matches if he's allowed to go 1 on 1, and it furthers Brock's spiral; Brock can't beat Lashley clean, Cody outsmarted him and it's no secret that cowboys and outlaws don't last long (see Red Dead, Any Sergio Leone film, Most things with Clint Eastwood, the actual time of the Cowboy which was about 6 years at the turn of the 20th century).

It makes sense for Cody to be shown as competent and capable, further illustrating how Roman escaped by the skin of his teeth at Mania & it works for Brock to be shown as vulnerable if this is how he begins his ride into the sunset. If nothing else it's refreshing to see a WWE babyface fight Brock with their brain instead of the heart Brock inevitably tears out of them. Card order was a little wonky but the crowd made the show pretty bulletproof, and recent coherent booking makes it easier to suspend disbelief.

CgeMh1Q_i0M,Jayjay,"I was a Cody Rhodes fan since he was in legacy. I bought his action figure with the purple underwear from legacy. Something about him always screamed star to me. I followed him through his mask days where he thought he was hideous and he did the best he could with a silly storyline. I saw him become stardust and it hurt to see him that way. I stopped watching wwe because I grew up and it got stale over the years. I then heard about aew and how Cody Rhodes played a big part and proved just how talented he is. And it brought a smile to my face. To think that this guy I believed in the entire time always had it in him and stuck it to the organization that oppressed him for years. When I heard he jumped ship back to wwe I was furious. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to see Cody live his dream as a wwe champion. But because I knew what the wwe would do to him. Anyone who understands the horrible business practices of wwe will have seen this coming a mile away. We watched a man who got his revenge on a Goliath of a company and went elsewhere and succeeded and gave the wwe a run for their money for a very brief time. Only to get humiliated like this. Ultimately I think this is a learning lesson for Cody. To be a man of conviction. His legacy could have ended with him getting vengeance instead it ends with embarrassment and disappointment . I believe aew had a good chance to compete with wwe but when Cody left it sent a very clear and powerful message to the wrestling fans ‚Äúwwe is THE brand‚Äù taking one of the biggest aew stars and wiping their ass with him is exactly what wwe always wanted. For all of you icw nerds just know that this won‚Äôt change. And that‚Äôs why I gave up on the wwe. Despite my feelings I‚Äôll follow Cody and I hope he‚Äôs at peace with his decisions. And to those who are heartbroken by the loss I laugh at you for not realizing sooner. The wwe slept on cody for years, he then became a nightmare for them, convinced him to follow his dream.

This gets to the stage that nobody actually WANTS to be Universal Champion any more because everyone's too scared of The Fiend, up until it finally comes time for a chosen babyface to take up the belt, meet The Fiend head on, and finally get that big triumphant win over him. But that's far too complicated a story for WWE to tell.","always said WWE done Fiend squash Rollins Universal Championship... discard belt backstage somewhere vanish again.

-GoUIfFwmek,S from,"A perfect match you say. Perfect for Roman because he cheats again.  Ref gets knocked out. Paul throws a chair in the ring. A second ref gets knocked out and then Jimmy comes in. Then Jey comes in and does nothing more then distract everyone. Sami's spear nails Jey and that's it. We all know because we all Sami beat Roman up just as we saw KO beat Roman up. So we all know that in a match without interference KO and Sami can both beat Roman. So guess what? That makes Roman nit the G.O.A.T. Overall it was your basic Roman match. He always needs someone else to help him. Like him or not it's true and the guy only has three moves. He has the superman punch, the spear and the drive by and that's it. Sami used two of Romans moves so that pretty much says it all right there. 
The chamber matches were great. Lesnar and Lashley match was stupid and a waste of time. It was indeed a cheap match.
Speculation or obvious? Sami and KO will take the tag titles from the Usos and the Usos will leave Roman to defend his titles on his own and he will lose to Cody if Cody doesn't get injured before WM.

x5LK_CBGzU4,Zuckerton,"Let's be honest here: What leverage do the Bucks and Omega actually have? They aren't bringing in more viewers (in fact, they've been chasing away viewers; quarter hour rating breakdowns have proven this), they aren't getting rave reviews for their stories, their starpower has actually fallen over the last three years, they are Buddy-Buddy with Dirtsheet writers who are constantly reporting on the backstage drama in AEW (some would say Bucks and friends are the ones giving this information to them). It was reported that the Young Bucks were to help book the tag division and the tag division means less now than it ever has, it was reported that Kenny Omega was supposed to help book the Woman's Division and the woman's segments are consistently the lowest-rated ones on the card (if not them, it's The Elite), they had Tony Kahn spend money on making Trios Titles while not building ANY Trios Teams.

What's their upside? They can do moves well?

CM Punk on the other hand? Most of his segments were the highest rated in the company. His short feud with Kingston was great and his feud with MJF was Feud of the Year. He's been praised PUBLICLY by actual AEW Personnel and talent, while being buried in the dirtsheets by anonymous sources that CLAIM people backstage hate him and have said this or that about him.

People complain that he ""can't go anymore"" and point to a few botches while completely overlooking all the other botches of ALL of the other talent in AEW. They misinterpret the selling of match fatigue for being ""blown up"" because they're used to guys who no-sell 95% of offense. They say he's a ""cancer"" and has been a problem ""everywhere he goes"", but can only point to two or three instances in the last 24 years to ""prove"" it, most of which the people involved said were overblown by reporters. Supposedly Jericho called him a cancer, but just came out saying he always loved working with Punk, which is the first public thing he's said about Punk since All Out, but he's been complimentary of Punk in the past. Not something he would do if Punk was ""always a problem"".

People need to stop treating gossip as gospel.","Let's honest here: leverage Bucks Omega actually have? bringing viewers (in fact, they've chasing away viewers; quarter hour rating breakdowns proven this), getting rave reviews stories, starpower actually fallen last three years, Buddy-Buddy Dirtsheet writers constantly reporting backstage drama AEW (some would say Bucks friends ones giving information them). reported Young Bucks help book tag division tag division means less ever has, reported Kenny Omega supposed help book Woman's Division woman's segments consistently lowest-rated ones card (if them, Elite), Tony Kahn spend money making Trios Titles building Trios Teams.

WxwJ9gA_FIE,Username,"How I Would Book The World Heavyweight Championship Return & Matches: 

The Smackdown after Wrestlemania:
The Rock Comes out to brag about his win over roman reigns. Then he starts ragging on the universal championship and says that he didn‚Äôt come back to dethrone roman reigns and win the universal championship. So he trashes that championship and brings back the world heavyweight championship. So right after does that Samoa Joe‚Äôs music hits and he returns. So he tells rock that he is back and back for only one thing, and thats for the world heavyweight championship and to retire rock. So rock accepts joe‚Äôs match for the world heavyweight championship as the main event later tonight. So its joe vs rock and the match is very physical and they are both going back & forward with each other. So joe gets up and really takes it to the rock and looks like he‚Äôs going to win. And rock finally gets a reversal and hits the rock bottom and defeats joe. So after the rock showboats for a while joe gets up and is in rege about his loss to the rock. Then he brutally attacks rock beats him with a chair & puts him through a table and walks off. Then austin theory comes out and hits his a - town down and wins the world heavyweight championship. So its the next week on smackdown & theory is so proud about his victory over the rock and challenges him for a rematch. But before that gets announced officially John Cena returns and demands that theory gives him a rematch for his loss at Wrestlemania. So rock & cena have a back and forward verbal spar before theory tells them he‚Äôs not facing either one of them. Them paul heyman comes out and announces a HUGE main event match tonight. And the match is cena vs rock and winner faces theory at backlash for the world heavyweight championship. So the match is set. So as the match is going it looks like cena is going to win and joe comes from underneath the ring to attack cena & rock cost them both the match and the show goes off. So the next week joes comes out to tell theory that hell be the one facing him at backlash. But Cena interrupts joe and tells him that he wont be facing theory at backlash and that hell be facing him at backlash is a falls count anywhere match. So joe accepts and they have a heated feud going back and forward for the next few weeks. So theory is now confused as to who he‚Äôs gonna face at backlash and rock comes out to tell him that he didn‚Äôt actually lose the match and that he‚Äôs gonna put his career on the line to get another championship shot at world heavyweight championship. So its backlash and and joe vs cena is the opening match witch is a 5 star match and cena wins clean. So now its timw for the main event. Theory vs Rock is very hard hitting match which looks like rock is gonna win but theory eventually geta the upperhand hits the rock with the a - town down and also wins clean. So theory showboats about his biggest victory yet for about 4 - 5 minutes and then walk away. Then rock slowly starts to get up and starts shedding a few tears and thanks the wwe superstars for giving him an amazing in ring career and annouces that he is officially retiring for good. Amd then tells theory the he‚Äôs thankful for having him as his final opponent and tells him that his career will be going to amazing heights!!! So its the smackdown after backlash and theory comes out again bragging about retiring one of the greatest legends of all times and says that their is no one in the locker room that can touch him now. And cena comes out and says that he wants his official one on one match against theory at crown jewel. So it‚Äôs official and cena is taking to theory like its 2007 all over again looking like he‚Äôs going win and the joe returns and attacks Cena again. So its the smackdown after corwn jewel and cena tells joe that he wants one last shot at joe to end this feud once and for all inside hell in a cell at the great american bash. So the match is set and cena wins clean again. So after that feud theory tells cena that he wants to give him one last opportunity at summerslam for the world heavyweight championship and the match is built as the main event of the night and theory dominates most of the match and wins clean. And then cena goes off tv for the remainder of the year and maybe return for the royal rumble or Wrestlemania next year. Then Theory goes on to have a one off match again joe at clash of the champions by winning clean and then going the have a top tier championship run!!! And thats how I would end the theory vs rock vs cena vs joe feud. Now that‚Äôs just how I would book the return of the world heavyweight championship and austin theory!!!","Would Book World Heavyweight Championship Return & Matches: Smackdown Wrestlemania: Rock Comes brag win roman reigns. starts ragging universal championship says didn‚Äôt come back dethrone roman reigns win universal championship. trashes championship brings back world heavyweight championship. right Samoa Joe‚Äôs music hits returns. tells rock back back one thing, thats world heavyweight championship retire rock. rock accepts joe‚Äôs match world heavyweight championship main event later tonight. joe vs rock match physical going back & forward other. joe gets really takes rock looks like he‚Äôs going win. rock finally gets reversal hits rock bottom defeats joe. rock showboats joe gets rege loss rock. brutally attacks rock beats chair & puts table walks off. austin theory comes hits - town wins world heavyweight championship. next week smackdown & theory proud victory rock challenges rematch. gets announced officially John Cena returns demands theory gives rematch loss Wrestlemania. rock & cena back forward verbal spar theory tells he‚Äôs facing either one them. paul heyman comes announces HUGE main event match tonight. match cena vs rock winner faces theory backlash world heavyweight championship. match set. match going looks like cena going win joe comes underneath ring attack cena & rock cost match show goes off. next week joes comes tell theory hell one facing backlash.

Then they lost against the tag team champions in their only clean important finish since winning the tag titles in a random ass title match they technically didn't earn, with no story. Then they lost to a tag team that actually deserved and needed it. Please tell me what you think of that.

Although Braun being set up to likely win the championship is infuriating and not someone Gunther should have to put over, Ricochet has definitely gotten a lot more fan support after that killer performance. It really just depends on how they move forward from here.

Honestly, I‚Äôm conflicted on the final segment. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the dynamic of Cena possibly being a contender for the Rumble championship match is exciting if Owens and he both challenge in a triple threat, maybe with each championship being defended in two separate falls. But the way it was done was WAY too predictable, and took away a lot of the anticipation of ‚ÄúWill the bloodline turn on Sami or not?‚Äù that was going into it. Instead, they could‚Äôve removed the segment, and any mention of Pierce before the final segment, and then they could‚Äôve had Roman mention something in the ring after saying he had a solution to the Owens problem about speaking to Pierce earlier in the night about booking a tag match in two weeks, which then could‚Äôve segwayed into the final moments of the show with Cena appearing. It would‚Äôve left the anticipation there without ruining any part of it, and still adds a new dynamic to the story. Definitely could‚Äôve been handled better.

I remember fantasy booking a faction of Wade Barrett, Drew McIntyre, Sheamus and Mason Ryan (managed by Finley) about 10 years ago, to have one member from England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales respectively. There's so much British talent in WWE, and while it's a new era with Vince gone, they've always loved to stoke the flames of 'foreign heels'. With NXT UK going under there is no shortage of potential members, and let's not forget the likes of Becky Lynch, Nikki Cross and Piper Niven to fill out the women's side. Hell at the moment I feel like they could make half the visible roster British if they wanted to.
In fact, great idea for an Adam booking video - How Adam would book The British Invasion. You could even have tension within the group from the Irish contingent of Finn Balor, Sheamus and Becky Lynch.","British Invasion angle something I've wanted see YEARS. remember fantasy booking faction Wade Barrett, Drew McIntyre, Sheamus Mason Ryan (managed Finley) 10 years ago, one member England, Scotland, Ireland Wales respectively.

I am finding it very hard to keep invested in AEW, it is a shame too, because I have watched all the shows from the very start, which I wasn't able to do with other companies.

But Aew's back stabbing or turning on your friend/ partner is a bit much, to the point I predict, the next fall out to be darby and sting. Eg.. Danny Garicia would of made a good pro wrestlers, they had us feed and invest into a story about it for weeks, for it to go back to normal and be a complete waste of tv time, when there are other talents that could of used that time slot.

Examples
WarJoe
Sammy Dont Like Inner Circle
Sammy JAS
Scorpio Sky and Ethan Page
Regal and Mox
MJF and Regal
House Of Black
Dark Order (NOW)
The Baddies
Eddie Kingston Debut ( Putting a wedge between Rey and Penta )
Weeler Yuta, ( Is he going to be a pro wrestler or is he not ) I THINK NOT.
Swerve and Lee
The Firm and MJF

The problem with this whole thing is not the backstage altercation. Cooler heads can prevail there, as we've seen many times in the past. The problem is that CM Punk broke the trust AEW had in him to be an onscreen presence the second he went into business for himself at the scrum(arguably the second he called out Hangman on his return to Dynamite). You can't do business with someone who will only ever protect themselves when push comes to shove.

All signs point to that person in question being Bruce Pitchard seeing as Nick was there during the years Bruce worked for TNA Impact, and we all know how easily Bruce can make or break careers in WWE while he was working under Vince. However since Vince is now gone and Bruce's power surely has diminished greatly, I can see Nick seeing this is the perfect time to try his luck in WWE again. 

I doubt he's going to AEW just because he can't do the flippy moves TK loves and he's not a big enough name to get away with not doing it. 

Impact would've seemed like a logical choice, but with his wife seemingly about to go into retirement for the forseeable future, trying his hand at WWE again seems more like the more logical choice. I can already seeing him becoming the male equivalent of Roxanne Perez/Rok-C in NXT if he does show up. Might even get a TNA reunion match between him and AJ Styles down the road if he ends up in WWE.","wonder Nick Aldis might showing NXT 2023? watched interview says reason never NXT someone very, successful WWE keeps preventing signed company. signs point person question Bruce Pitchard seeing Nick years Bruce worked TNA Impact, know easily Bruce make break careers WWE working Vince.

Furthermore we know Bruce was one of Vince's right hand men and can easily make or break a wrestler's career as easily as Kevin Dunn can. Then added to the fact if Nick is indeed doing to try and get hired by WWE again, whoever was preventing him from joining the company must have lost a lot of power in the company if not outright gone. Who in WWE do we know that description fits this year? Vince and his yes men. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Nick is going to try another shot at WWE if Bruce was the one preventing him from getting hired since Vince and gone and Bruce would have little to no power to make or break a wrestler's career like he did in the past.","watching short interview Nick said reason never hired NXT someone ""very, successful"" company prevented getting signed. people would automatically think wrestler, anyone else thinks Bruce Pritchard? know Nick Bruce worked TNA Impact double checked company, company exact years.

io1Wtc7awG0,Patrick Noll,"I am officially skipping every time this channel, Whatculture and Cultaholic talk about the Elite, Punk and everything related. What it comes down to is that you all regurgitate Meltzer as if he is the unquestionable truth, and he is so very clearly, unabashedly, in the camp of the Young Bucks and AEW. He and Alvarez barely try to hide their skew, and not one of you even questions it.

It is a shame because I like the personalities on those shows. I think it is largely because you really want to be fans more than critical reporters, so it is easier to just succumb to para-social relationships with the Elite, and accept Big Dave's comforting tales without examination.

Seriously, does not one on your staff on any of these channels think it is weird that one week, Dave is complaining because no one is giving updates on the story, then a few days later, Dave is saying Larry couldn't have been hurt because he would have heard about it? NOT ONE OF YOU?

There are a lot of other examples of this lack of critical thinking (the timing and location of the fight, the people who were there, the details leading up to the fight, etc). So many, in fact, that it is pointless to even address because it is clear no one wants to see them. And the truth is, I watch things to enjoy them.

io1Wtc7awG0,Susan - Me$a AZ,"Here's the thing and honestly doesn't matter if the story about Larry is a lie or the truth. My issue is and always has been the fact that the bucks, Omega are EVPs, that they were seen talking to the number two in the company who's also the head of HR mega, and that they all went down to punk's room and effectively forced their way in. Of course things are going to escalate. That's my issue and that's a lot of people's issues they're not just the boys, they're executive vice presidents. That is my issue and that's a lot of people's issues, the fact that you have people that are supposed to be in some position of power going down to their top Stars locker room just because they don't like them, the fact that they started this little whisper campaign that he had something to do with Colt Cabana not being there, the fact that there was no action taken to hangman page going into business for himself. Yet punk is the bad guy for going into business for himself when he returned from his first injury, I'm not defending what punk did by going into business for himself with that first promo back, nor my defending what he said at the little media scrum, but if you're going to punch one you got to punch the other. And the fact that this was so secretive, who is the investigating party? Wasn't an internal investigation was it an outside investigation was it done by the network? Frankly, 2 months of paid vacation I don't think is enough for the bucks and Omega. I think that Tony Khan needs to start acting like a f****** wrestling promoter and actually have some real disciplinary action against them. And let's not forget freaking Jericho in this equation, he's done a real good job maneuvering himself as a wannabe locker room leader. But you're not a locker room leader Jericho, you weren't one in WWE and just because these guys are green and dumb and new to the business doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be one here. There's a reason people talk about the kind of locker room leader undertaker was, I guarantee you we are not going to be talking about Chris Jericho in the same way in terms of locker room leader.","Here's thing honestly matter story Larry lie truth. issue always fact bucks, Omega EVPs, seen talking number two company who's also head HR mega, went punk's room effectively forced way in. course things going escalate.

LUYQCAdqldE,Thecryofthemonsterwasloudandstrange,"How can you run a wrestling show and hate AEW? WWE sucks. It hasn‚Äôt been good in decades. It is a kiddies soap opera filled with digital garbage and no actual wrestling, even with Triple H in charge. I‚Äôll use a point here on just how bad WWE is. The cage match was created to end a feud, it was to make opponents bleed, since WWE is still kiddie trash, no blood, so it makes the cage pointless. And the only way WWE made any money was off of its Peacock deal and Saudi Arabia tours. That‚Äôs it. They made all those cuts BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT MAKING MONEY WWE ‚ÄúMark‚Äù. AEW drew higher numbers here in Canada, well AEW was in an actual arena, WWE was doing shows in buildings the size of a school gymnasium, and they still did not sell out. The only reason WWE has seen an increase in ratings, is because of the Bray Wyatt angle, but even that will become stale and WWE‚Äôs numbers will drop. AEW is wrestling, WWE is still ‚ÄúSports Entertainment‚Äù, a term quoted by an owner that rehired a pedophile that was apart of the ring boy scandal, got his wrestlers to inject steroids(That‚Äôs why a lot died young), and sexually assaults women. And do think Stephanie McMachon didn‚Äôt know about this. Well let me refresh your memory, she was removed from her position, well it came out about her father paying off women hush money, then when he ‚Äúretires‚Äù, suddenly she‚Äôs back and in charge, HELLO. WWE is üí©. And the reason AEW hasn‚Äôt come out with anything as of yet, IS BECAUSE IT IS A LEGAL MATTER BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. No different then them not releasing everything on the Vince McMachon situation. WWE wishes they could capture the energy that the AEW fans bring, that‚Äôs why they brought back Cody Rhodes and packaged him exactly the same way as AEW, AEW made Cody Rhodes relevant again, he wouldn‚Äôt have even gotten a multi million dollar deal if it wasn‚Äôt for AEW. So please stop hosting a wrestling show and keep watching a kiddies non wrestling show with a bunch of woman‚Äôs soap opera Bullüí©.

Why would you want the autograph of a guy you‚Äôre supposed to hate? Unfortunately, I think sports entertainment Jericho is in Tony‚Äôs ear, telling him that MJF needs to turn face because he wants the top heel spot all to himself. MJF may eventually turn face, but a guy who uses foreign objects to win is not a face, unless he‚Äôs a true underdog and his opponent is even worse. When Stone Cold stunnered McMahon, he was a hero because the Mr McMahon character was so vile that that was what you wanted to see. He was fighting back against the heel.
